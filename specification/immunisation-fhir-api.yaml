    ## Overview
     
    Use this API to access a patient's immunisation record. It is part of the [Vaccinations Data Flow Management](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/vaccinations-data-flow-management) It is intended to extend and replace [Immunisation History - FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/immunisation-history-fhir) and existing [Vaccination](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/vaccination) flows. 

    ### You can:
     
    - create a record a patient immunisation
    - search for a patient's immunisation records
    - get the details of an immunisation record
    - update an immunisation record
    - identify an immunisation record as entered in error
     
    ### You cannot use this API to:
     
    - retrieve the immunisation record of multiple patients at once
    - retrieve the immunisation events for vaccinations other than for coronavirus (`COVID-19`), influenza (`FLU`), human papillomavirus (`HPV`)
    - record a patient's demographic details
    > To get demographic details from the [Personal Demographics Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/personal-demographics-service), use the Personal Demographics FHIR API.
     
    You can create, read, update and delete the following data:
     
    - immunisation event details for `COVID-19`, `FLU`, `HPV`
      
    ### Data availability, timing and quality
 
    In most cases the record is available within 48 hours of the immunisation event, sometimes sooner.
 
    If the NHS number is not present on a record then you will not be able to Search for that record and will only be able to retrieve the record by Reading it using its unique ID.
 
    The `COVID-19` data is limited to vaccinations recorded on behalf of NHS England.
 
    The `FLU` data is limited to vaccinations recorded on behalf of NHS England.
 
    The `HPV` data is limited to vaccinations recorded on behalf of NHS England.
     
    ## Who can use this API
    This API can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development.
   
    You must demonstrate you have a valid use case as part of digital onboarding.
   
    You must do this before you can go live (see 'Onboarding' below).
   
    ### Who can access immunisation event records
     
    Health and care organisations in England can access immunisation records.
   
    Legitimate direct care examples include NHS organisations delivering healthcare, local authorities delivering care, third sector and private sector health and care organisations, and developers delivering systems to health and care organisations.
   
    Patients who receive health and social care or make use of NHS services in England.
   
    Examples of recognised uses for the immunisation event records include:
     
    - supporting a patient getting a vaccination
    - supporting patient managing their immunisation health
    - identifying those to be invited to vaccination nationally
    - identifying those to be invited to vaccination locally
    - supporting the booking of a vaccination appointment
    - supporting the payment reconciliation process on behalf of NHS England/NHS Business Services Authority
    - supporting measuring the overall success of a vaccination campaign to help inform the success of the [NHS Vaccination Strategy](https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/nhs-vaccination-strategy/)
  
    ## API status and roadmap
    This API is [in development](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses). It is subject to regular change and update to recieve feedback on the API design by the users of the services it replaces and input from [Clinical Safety](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/clinical-safety).
     
    To see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?tag=immunisation).
     
    If you have any other queries, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).

    This API is still in development and has not yet undergone a [Clinical Safety](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/clinical-safety) review.
     
    ## Service level
    This API will be a platinum service, meaning it is operational and supported 24 x 7 x 365.
     
    For more details, see [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).
     
    ## Technology
     
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).
     
    It conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange, specifically to [FHIR R4 (v4.0.1)](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/), except that it does not support the [capabilities](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities) interaction.
     
    It includes some country-specific FHIR extensions, which conform to [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core), specifically [fhir.r4.ukcore.stu1 0.5.1](https://simplifier.net/packages/fhir.r4.ukcore.stu1/0.5.1).
     
    You do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules.
    In particular:
    - resource names are capitalised and singular, and use US spellings, for example `/Immunization` not `/immunisations`
    - array names are singular, for example `entry` not `entries` for address lines
    - data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object
     
    There are [libraries and SDKs available](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks) to help with FHIR API integration.
     
    ## Network access
    This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).
     
    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).
     
    ## Security and authorisation
     
    This API has two access modes:
    - application-restricted access
    - user-restricted access search only access 
     
    ### Application-restricted access
     
    This access mode is [application-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#application-restricted-apis), meaning we authenticate the calling application but not the end user.
     
    To use this access mode, use the following security pattern:
    - [Application-restricted RESTful API - signed JWT authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-signed-jwt-authentication)
 
    Access may be restricted to certain functionallity based on your user need
     
    ### User-restricted access
     
    Use this [user-restricted access mode](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis) if the end user is a patient:
    * the end user must have their identity verified to 'high' (P9) level
    * the NHS number in the request must match the NHS number in the NHS login account
    * the functionallity will be restricted to only allow the end user to search for thier own record
     
    To use this access mode, use the following security pattern:
    * [User-restricted RESTful APIs - NHS login separate authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-login-separate-authentication-and-authorisation)

      email: api.management@nhs.net
 
    ## Errors
    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:

    * 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action
    * 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application
    * 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server
    Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes) for more on errors.

    ### Sandbox testing
    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):
    * is for early developer testing
    * only covers a limited set of scenarios
    * is stateless, so does not actually persist any updates
    * is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation

    For details of sandbox test scenarios, or to try out the sandbox using our 'Try this API' feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.

    ### Integration testing
    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):
    * is for formal integration testing
    * is stateful, so persists updates
    * includes authorisation, with options for user-restricted access (with or without [smartcards](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers)) and application-restricted access     
    
    For read-only testing, we will provide an Immunisation records test pack soon.

    To test updating patient details, you must set up your own test data.

    For more details see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).
 
    ## Onboarding
      
    You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API.
    We call this onboarding.
    The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it is worth planning well ahead.
  
    Whilst this API is in Alpha it is not possible to onboard to this API.
    As part of this process, you need to demonstrate that you can manage risks and that your software conforms technically with the requirements for this API.
    Information on this page might impact the design of your software.
  
    To understand how our online digital onboarding process works, see [digital onboarding](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/digital-onboarding#using-the-digital-onboarding-portal).

      description: |
        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to search for a patient's vaccination records using their NHS number, in order to.
        - view the patients immunisation history
        - retrieve an ID for an immunisation event to use when updating a record

        > This operating is both availble as a 'POST' and a 'GET' operation
        
        You MUST specify the disease type(s) for the vaccination records you want by including the 'immunization.target' parameter.
        You MAY also limit the records returned by date of vaccination by including the 'date.to' and / or 'date.from' parameters.
        
        You MUST also request the patient resource is returned by using the '_include' parameter.
                
        If no records match the specified criteria for the search an empty response will be returned.
        
        The records returned in response to a search will not include sensitive data items as follows:
        - Personally identifiable details of the administering indervidual

        The behaviour of this endpoint depends on which access mode you are using:

        ## Overview
        This endpoint allows you to update an immunisation event record. 
		
        You MUST retrieve the existing immunization event ID
        > To retrieve the latest event IDs for a patients immunisations you should first search for the patients immunisation events 
        
        You MUST only update records which you have appropriate responsibility for.
        
        A new record will be recorded and supercede the existing record it is updating.
        
        If no exiting record is present then a new record will be recorded.

        A new record ID will be returned once the operation is complete.

        ## Overview
        
        This endpoint allows you to delete an immunisation event record.
        
        You MUST ensure you have the correct ID for the record you wish to delete and only attempt to delete a record which you have appropriate responsibility for.

        A successful request will result in a logical deletion of the record making it unavailable to future access via these endpoints but it will be retained in audit logs.
        ## Sandbox testing
        You can test the following scenarios in our sandbox environment:
